## Summer term 2018: Multidimensional calculus of variations (M4)

Lectures: Tuesday,   13:00 (ct), RUD 25, 3.007 and Thursday, 09:00 (ct), RUD 25, 3.007
Tutorial: Tuesday, 15.00  (ct), RUD 25, 3.007

### Content

In the theory of calculus of variations, we consider functionals defined on
sets of functions with the goal to find critical points of these functionals.
Typical applications are: The circle maximizes the area for a given perimeter.  
The soap film minimizes the area for given volume.  
A stable elastic deformation minimizes the elastic energy. 
The lecture starts by recalling  the classical theory  starting from  Bernoulli  to  Weierstrass for the one-dimensional setting. 
Using simple functional analytic  methods we extend the theory to the  multidimensional
case including nonlinear elasticity theory.

## Winter term 2017/2018: Optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows

Lecture: Tuesday, 9.00 am (ct), RUD 25, 4.007, weekly
Tutorial: Tuesday, 11.00 am (ct), RUD 25, 4.007, every 2nd week

### Content
The optimal transport problem was already formulated by  Gaspard Monge  in  the  18  century. It  deals  with  the  relocation  of  an  initial distribution of mass to a final distribution, such that the cost  of transport is minimal. The formulation of  this problem was generalized by Kantorovich in 1942.  Besides  the  original  applications in   economy,  new connections  to Problems in geometry, probability theory, and analysis emerged. In particular, in  the  recent  decades  a  strong  connection  between partial  differential equations, that describe diffusion  processes, could  be made. These diffusion problems can  be formulated as gradient flows of the system's  entropy and the so-called Wasserstein distance.

In this module, we introduce the problem of optimal transport, discuss basic results and  applications:  Monge- and Kantorovich formulation, existence of optimal transport plans, dual formulation, dynamical  formulation, diffusion equations as Wasserstein gradient flows.
